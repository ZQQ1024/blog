1. 白皮书是什么：
   ```
   A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that 
   informs readers concisely about a complex issue 
   and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. 
   It is meant to help readers understand an issue, 
   solve a problem, or make a decision.
   ```
2. 关于ARM：
   - ARM develops the `architecture` and licenses it to other companies, and also designs `cores` that implement this instruction set
   - Architecture versions `ARMv3 to ARMv7` support 32-bit address space,and 32-bit arithmetic; most architectures have 32-bit fixed-length instructions.
   - Released in 2011, the `ARMv8-A` architecture added support for a 64-bit address space and 64-bit arithmetic with its new 32-bit fixed-length instruction set.
   - Core licence:
  ```
     ARM Holdings' primary business is selling IP cores, 
     which licensees use to create microcontrollers (MCUs), CPUs, and systems-on-chips 
     based on those cores.
  ```
   - Architectural licence:
  ```
     Companies can also obtain an ARM architectural licence 
     for designing their own CPU cores using the ARM instruction sets.
  ```
   - The Cortex-A5 / A7 / A8 / A9 / A12 / A15 / A17 cores implement the ARMv7-A architecture.
   - The Cortex-A32 / A35 / A53 / A57 / A72 / A73 cores implement the ARMv8-A architecture.

3. `thumb`，是大拇指的意思，也有与其他四个相比矮的意思
4. `Arm trustzone`介绍：  
   [https://developer.arm.com/technologies/trustzone](https://developer.arm.com/technologies/trustzone)
   ```
   The family of TrustZone technologies can be integrated into any Arm Cortex-A core.
   Arm TrustZone-enabled AMBA bus fabric.
   making use of processor extensions.Each physical processor core provides two virtual cores.
5. `Arm trusted firmware`介绍（还没看完）：   
   [https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/+/v0.4-rc2/docs/firmware-design.md](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/+/v0.4-rc2/docs/firmware-design.md)
6. A better WeChat on macOS and Linux. Built with Electron:
   [https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/electronic-wechat](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/electronic-wechat)  
   这个不能用了的话，就网页版微信吧
7. Ubuntu Desktop Shortcut:
   - 找个模板`~/example.desktop`或者`/usr/share/application`或者`~/.local/share/application`，放在桌面，要增加可执行权限
   - 桌面的desktop，运行后不能Pin到Dock上，但是可以拖上去
   - 重点修改`Icon`和`Exec`字段
   - 放在`/usr/share/application`或者`~/.local/share/application`目录下面，就可以在`Dash`那里搜索到了
