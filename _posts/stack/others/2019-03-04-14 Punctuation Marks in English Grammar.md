英语语法中，14种常见的标点符号。因为标点符号在代码中也有特殊的含义，经常不知道英文文献中说的标点符号具体是哪个。

##### 句子结尾

1. period (`.`):
- 放于句子结尾表陈述句结束：`Jane and Jack went to the market.`
- 放于缩写词之后：`Her son, John Jones Jr., was born on Dec. 6, 2008.`

2. question mark (`?`):
- 表明`direct question`，直接疑问句：`When did Jane leave for the market?`

3. exclamation point (`!`):
- 在对话中，表示交叫：`"Holy cow!" screamed Jane.`
- 表示强调：`My mother-in-law's rants make me furious!`

##### 句子暂停

4. comma (`,`):
- 呼语：`Thanks for all your help, John.`
- 句子的分离，没说完继续说：`We went to the movies, and then we went out to lunch.`
- 分离列表中的元素：`Suzi wanted the black, green, and blue dress.`

5. semicolon (`;`):
- 连接句子，句子之间有微弱的联系：`John was hurt; he knew she only said it to upset him.`

6. colon (`:`):
- 跟在一个词后面，引出应用、解释、例子和系列等：`He was planning to study four subjects: politics, philosophy, sociology and economics.
`
- 在两个句子中间，第二句对第一句进行解释：`I didn't have time to get changed: I was already late.`
- 表强调：`There was one thing she loved more than any other: her dog.`

##### 连字符等

7. hyphen 连字符:
- 连接几个单词组成复合词：`part-time, back-to-back, well-known`

8. dash:
- en dash，比连字符长一点，表示一个范围或区间：`1880-1945 or Princeton-New York trains`
- em dash, 长度是`en dash`的两倍，用于增强可读性和强调结果：`She gave him her answer - No!`

dash键盘上好像打不出来

##### 括号

9. Brackets (`[]`):
- 方括号，阐述含义，移除句子仍然通顺：`He [Mr. Jones] was the last person seen at the house.`

10. Braces (`{}`):
- 尖括号，包含几个`item`作为一个`unit`

11. Parentheses (`()`):
- 圆括号

##### 其他

12. apostrophe (`'`): 
- 单词中字母的省略：` I've seen that movie several times. She wasn't the only one who knew the answer.`
- 所有格`Possessive case`：`Sara's dog bit the neighbor.`
- 表示多个字母：`Six people were told to mind their p's and q's.`注意礼貌的意思

13. Quotations marks (`""`):
- 引用别人说的话：`"Don't go outside," she said.`
- Single quotation marks，引用中的引用

14. ellipsis (`...`):
- 单词的省略：`She began to count, "One, two, three, four…" until she got to 10, then went to find him.`
- 引用中话的神略：`When Newton stated, "An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion..." he developed the law of motion.`
